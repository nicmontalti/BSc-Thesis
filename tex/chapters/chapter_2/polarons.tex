\chapter{The polaron problem} \label{ch:polarons}

In this chapter we will derive and compare different models that are used to describe polarons. We will start with the Landau-Pekar model, the first to be proposed and the simplest one. Then, Fr√∂hlich and Holstein models will be discussed. These two models are the ones currently used to describe respectively large and small polarons. A comparison of these two types of polarons is made in the last section.
