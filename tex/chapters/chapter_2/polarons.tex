\chapter{The polaron problem} \label{ch:polarons}

In this chapter, we describe and compare different models that have been proposed for the description of polarons. We start by reviewing the Landau-Pekar model, the first to be proposed and the simplest one. Then, Fr√∂hlich and Holstein models are discussed as well. These two models are currently used for the description of large and small polarons, respectively. A comparison of the properties of small and large polarons is presented in the last section.
