\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This work would have not been possible without the help and the support of many people, more than this page could contain. Not only the ones that have contributed directly or indirectly to it in the past months, but everyone I met along the path of taking this degree.

First of all, I want to thank my supervisor Prof. Cesare Franchini for giving me the opportunity of working on such an interesting topic. I am grateful for the time he dedicated to me and to this work. I also want to thank Lorenzo Varrassi for the help he gave me understanding DFT and VASP. I would not have been able to conclude this work without his advices. Finally, I am grateful to the Department of Physics of the University of Bologna for letting me use their HPC Cluster for running my calculations.

I want to thank my family, especially my parents and grandparents, for believing in me and encouraging my passion in Physics. This work is dedicated to my mother, who could not fulfill the dream of studying this subject like me. I thank my father for his patience, his support and for feeding my curiosity since I was child. I am grateful to my sisters, for bearing me talking about my work, and to my grandparents, for their support and interest in my studies.

Between my friends, a special thanks goes to Mattia, Adriano, Alessandro and Pietro, for making me feel home in a city it has never been really mine. I will never be able to repay them for their heartwarming hospitality. I have to thank Alessandro in particular for all the time he dedicated to listening to me, and Claudia and Lorenzo for their friendship and the time we spent together.

I also want to thank Lorenzo and Alice, who have been two invaluable peers in the path to obtaining this degree. They have had a major role in keeping my curiosity and my enthusiasm always high in the past years. They have been among the few people I could actually discuss my work with, and help me when I needed it.

A final, heartfelt thanks goes to Edoardo, Thomas, Jakob F., Jakob S., Samira, Riley, and all the other wonderful people I met in Groningen. With them, I spent the best months of my studies. Each of them changed me in their own way, making me discover a whole new me I could have not found otherwise. I am sure we will meet again many times all over Europe.

I hope that all these people will be as proud of this work as I am, even the ones who might not understand it.
