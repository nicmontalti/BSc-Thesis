\section{Results and discussion}
%In this section, we present and discuss the results obtained from the calculations described above. We start by discussing the results of the calculations on the unit cell, with particular emphasis on the comparison between  standard DFT and DFT+U. We then look at the results obtained using a supercell. The formation of the polaron is compared with a system with an extra delocalized electron.

\subsection{DFT and DFT+U calculation on rutile}
The results of the DFT and DFT+U calculations on the rutile unit cell are reported in \cref{fig:bands_unit}.

    \label{fig:bands_unit}
\end{figure}
In the diagrams, the zero of the energy has been shifted to the top of the highest valence band, so that all the electrons are situated in the region $E < 0$. An energy gap is clearly visible both in the band structure and in the DOS. The band gap is found to be direct, meaning that both the top of the highest valence band and the bottom of the lowest conduction band are found in correspondence of the same $k$-point; here it is the $\Gamma$ k-point. As expected, the energy gap is larger in the DFT+U calculation. The standard DFT calculation returned a gap of \SI{1.83}{eV}, whereas the DFT+U calculation a gap of \SI{2.33}{eV}.

In \cref{fig:bands_super}, the band structure and the DOS of the rutile supercell are reported.

We expected the band structure and the DOS of the supercell to be very similar to the unit cell ones, the main difference being that in the supercell many more bands are accessible. This is due to the bigger number of atoms, since each individual atom contributes to the total band structure with its own atomic orbitals. Band-unfolding techniques have been developed to overcome this inconvenience, reducing the supercell band structure to the unit cell one \cite{mayo2020}. However, since the exact band structure of rutile was not the main focus of this work, these techniques were not employed. Nevertheless, in \cref{fig:bands_super} we can still clearly see a band structure and a DOS similar to the ones observed in \cref{fig:bands_unit_dft+u}. The energy gap is of \SI{2.33}{eV}, as it was for the unit cell in the DFT+U calculation.
In both diagrams, the DOS has been divided by the total number of atoms $N$ to make the results comparable.

\subsection{Electron localization}
The localization of the extra electron was successful: the electron localized  on the vanadium atom and remained localized at the centre of the supercell in the following steps. The localization on the central vanadium atom was clearly visible from the  eigenvalues, since a new state with spin $+1/2$ was found in the conduction band. The vanadium atom was the only one with a magnetic moment different from zero, equal to $1.093 \mu_B$. After the substitution of vanadium with titanium, with a $U-J$ value of \SI{9}{eV}, the localization was confirmed by a magnetic moment on the central atom of $0.930 \mu_B$. Finally, setting $U-J$ to \SI{3.9}{eV}, the electron remained localized. The magnetic moment on the central titanium atom was $0.787 \mu_B$.

\subsection{Polaron}
The DOS and the band structure of the polaronic solution are reported in \cref{fig:polaron_bands}. An extra state is clearly visible both in the DOS and in the band structure, \SI{0.70}{eV} below the conduction band. This is compatible with the expectations for small polarons, which usually create a new state approximately \SI{1}{eV} below the conduction band. In the DOS diagram, the total DOS has been plotted together with its projection on the central titanium atom. It is interesting to pay attention to the region between \SI{-0.2}{eV} and \SI{0.0}{eV}, where the polaronic state can be found. Here, most of the contribution to the total DOS is given by the projection on the central atom, meaning that the electron is mostly localized on this atom.

The previous plot can be compared with \cref{fig:delocalized_bands}, where the delocalized solution is shown. We notice that the zero of the energy is shifted up to the bottom of the conduction band, which now coincides with the top of the valence band. Both the band structure and the DOS show that the extra electron enters the conduction band, and that no new state is created in the middle of the energy gap. The contribution of the central atom  to the total DOS is not as relevant as before. This is compatible with an electron delocalized in the material, where the central atom does not play any particular role.

The two cases can also be compared looking at the charge isosurfaces. The total charge density was projected on the band of the extra electron. The result is displayed in \cref{fig:isosurfaces_supercell} for the entire supercell and in \cref{fig:isosurfaces_center} with a focus on the central atom. From \cref{fig:polaron_iso_super} it is clearly visible how in the polaronic case the charge is localized at the centre of the supercell. The exact shape of the charge isosurface is better visible in \cref{fig:polaron_iso}. Here it is also emphasized how the localization of the charge is possible only thanks to the displacement of the oxygen atoms. The four oxygen atoms closer to the titanium atom are displaced by \SI{0.085}{\angstrom} outwards, whereas the two further oxygen atoms by \SI{0.023}{\angstrom}. In the delocalized case, displayed in \cref{fig:delocalized_iso_super,fig:delocalized_iso}, the electron is delocalized both on the titanium and oxygen atoms.
