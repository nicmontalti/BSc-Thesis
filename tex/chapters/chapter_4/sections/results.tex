\subsection{DFT and DFT+U calculation on rutile}
In this section, we present the results of the calculations described above. We start by discussing the results of the calculations on the unit cell, confronting the standard DFT and DFT+U approaches. We then look at the results of the supercell with an extra electron, comparing the delocalized solution with the formation of the polaron.

The results of the calculations on the unit cell are reported in \cref{fig:bands_unit}. The band gap between the valence and conduction band is immediately visible, both in the band structure diagram and in the DOS plot. The energy scale is shifted to have the zero at the top of the valence band. At \SI{0}{\kelvin}, all the electrons are in the valence band, under the band gap.

The band gap is found to be direct, meaning that both the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are found in correspondence of the $\Gamma$ k-point. As expected, the gap is larger in the DFT+U calculation. The standard DFT calculation returned a band gap of \SI{1.83}{eV}, whereas the DFT+U calculation a band gap of \SI{2.33}{eV}.

We expected the results of the calculation on the supercell, without the extra electron, to be similar to the results of the unit cell. The band structure and the DOS of the rutile supercell is displayed in \cref{fig:bands_super}. It is immediately visible that in the supercell many more bands are accessible. This is due to the bigger number of atoms. Each atom contribute to the band structure with its own atomic orbitals and electrons, so it is natural to have more bands with more atoms. Band-unfolding techniques have been developed to overcome this inconvenience, reducing the supercell band structure diagram to the unit cell one \cite{mayo2020}. However, since the exact band structure of rutile was not the main focus of this work, this was not done. Nevertheless, in \cref{fig:bands_super} we can still clearly see a band gap and a DOS similar to the ones observed in \cref{fig:bands_unit_dft+u}. In both diagrams, the DOS has been divided by the total number of atoms to make the results comparable.

\subsection{Electron localization}
We now briefly look at the results of the process of localizing the extra electron at the centre of the cell.

Substituting the titanium atom in the middle of the cell with a vanadium atom with a high $U$-value resulted in a well localized electron at the center of the cell. Observing the resulting eigenvalues, a new state with spin +$\mu_B$ was found in the conduction band. The magnetic moments of the atoms were  all zero except for the vanadium one. The central vanadium atom had a magnetic moment of $1.093 \mu_B$.

Once we succeeded in localizing the electron, we had to replace the vanadium atom with the original titanium one. With the titanium atom, and a high $U$-value, the extra electron remained localized. This was confirmed by a magnetic moment on the central atom of $0.930 \mu_B$ and an extra state in the valence band. Finally, setting $U-J$ to \SI{3.9}{eV} for the central titanium atom, the final polaron state was found. The magnetic moment on the central atom was $0.787 \mu_B$ and a new state was created \SI{0.70}{eV} under the conduction band (in correspondence of the $\Gamma$ k-point).

\subsection{Polaron}

The DOS and the band structure of the polaronic solution are displayed in \cref{fig:polaron_bands}. An extra state is clearly visible both in the DOS and in the band structure, \SI{0.70}{eV} below the conduction band in correspondence of the $\Gamma$ point. In the DOS diagram, the total DOS has been plotted together with the projection of the DOS on the central titanium atom. It is interesting to pay attention to the region between \SI{-0.2}{eV} and \SI{0.0}{eV}, which is the energy region of the polaron. Here, most of the contribution to the total DOS is given by the projection on the central atom. This means that the electron is mostly localized on this atom. In other energy regions, the central atom contributes to the total DOS as every other atom, so on average for $1/N$ where $N = 162$ is the total number of atoms in the supercell.

The aforementioned plot has to be compared with the diagram in \cref{fig:delocalized_bands}. Here, it is displayed the delocalized solution. We notice that this time the electron enters the conduction band, and no new state is created in the middle of the energy gap. This is confirmed by the DOS. We see that some states just below \SI{0.0}{eV} are filled by the extra electron. The central atom contribution to the total DOS is not as relevant as before. This is compatible with an electron delocalized in the material, with all the atoms contributing in equal amounts to the total DOS.

The two cases can also be compared looking at the charge isosurfaces.
To focus on the extra electron charge density, we have projected the total charge density on the band of the extra electron. The result is displayed in \cref{fig:isosurfaces_supercell,fig:isosurfaces_center}. In the first figure, the entire supercell is shown, whereas in the second one only the central atom with the six nearest-neighbours oxygen atoms. From \cref{fig:polaron_iso_super} it is clearly visible how in the polaronic case the charge is localized in the centre of the supercell. The exact shape of the charge isosurface is better visible in \cref{fig:polaron_iso}. Here it is also emphasized how the localization of the charge is possible only thanks to the displacement of the oxygen atoms. The four oxygen atoms closer to the titanium atom are displaced by \SI{0.085}{\angstrom} outwards, whereas the two further oxygen atoms by \SI{0.023}{\angstrom}. In the delocalized case, displayed in \cref{fig:delocalized_iso_super,fig:delocalized_iso}, the electron is delocalized on both the titanium and oxygen atoms.

% The DFT+U correction was implemented in following the Duradev approach, setting the value of U to \SI{3.9}{eV} \cite{reticcioli2022}. The correction was applied to the d-orbitals of titanium, leaving the other orbitals unaltered.
