\chapter{Simulation of a small polaron in rutile} \label{ch:simulation}
Rutile is the most common natural form of titanium dioxide ($\ce{TiO_2}$). It is a material that has been vastly studied in the past decades \cite{franchini2021b}. It is known to be prone to the formation of small electron polarons, which give rise to an optically detected deep level below the conduction band. However, experiments seem to produce conflicting results: optical and spin-resonance techniques reveal strongly localized small polarons, while electrical measurements show high mobilities that can only be explained by delocalized free electrons. It was shown that small polarons can actually coexist with delocalized electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, the former being only slightly more energetically favoured over the latter \cite{janotti2013}.

In this chapter, we discuss the simulation of a small polaron in rutile. The DFT+U calculation was run on VASP on a $3\times3\times3$ supercell. We start by discussing the procedure that was followed to trap an extra electron in the $\ce{TiO_2}$ supercell. Then, the resulting density of states and band structure are discussed. Particular emphasis is given to the comparison with a delocalized solution, where the electron enters the conduction band.
