\chapter{Simulation of a Small Polaron in $\ce{TiO_2}$} \label{ch:simulation}
Rutile is the most common natural form of titanium dioxide ($\ce{TiO_2}$), and it has been vastly studied in the past decades \cite{franchini2021b}. It is known to be prone to the formation of small electron polarons, which give rise to an optically detected deep level at \SI{0.8}{eV} below the conduction band. The polaronic state is energetically favored over a delocalized solution. However, the  energy difference between the localized and delocalized solution is of only \SI{-0.15}{eV} \cite{janotti2013}.

In this chapter, we will discuss the simulation of a small polaron in rutile. The simulation was run on VASP. We will start by discussing the procedure that was followed to trap an extra electron in a $\ce{TiO_2}$ supercell to form a polaron. Then, the resulting DOS and band structure will be discussed.
