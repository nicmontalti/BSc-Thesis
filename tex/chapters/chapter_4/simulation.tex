\chapter{Simulation of a small polaron in rutile} \label{ch:simulation}
Rutile is the most common natural form of titanium dioxide ($\ce{TiO_2}$), and it has been vastly studied in the past decades \cite{franchini2021b}. It is known to be prone to the formation of small electron polarons, which give rise to an optically detected deep level below the conduction band. However, experiments seem to produce conflicting results: optical and spin-resonance techniques reveal strongly localized small polarons, while electrical measurements show high mobilities that can only be explained by delocalized free electrons. It was shown that small polarons can actually coexist with delocalized electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, the former being energetically only slightly more favorable \cite{janotti2013}.

In this chapter, we will discuss the simulation of a small polaron in rutile. The DFT+U simulation was run on a $3\times3\times3$ supercell on VASP. We will start by discussing the procedure that was followed to trap an extra electron in the $\ce{TiO_2}$ supercell. Then, the resulting DOS and band structure will be discussed. Particular emphasis will be given to the comparison with a delocalized solution, with the electron in the conduction band.
