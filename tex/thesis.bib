The fundamental physics is emphasized and mathematical formalism is avoided. The book gives a clear guide to how different types of polaron form and the measurements used to identify them. Analyses of four diverse physical problems illustrate polaron effects producing dramatic physical phenomena. The first part of the book describes the principles governing polaron and bipolaron formation in different classes of materials. The second part emphasizes distinguishing electronic-transport and optical phenomena through which polarons manifest themselves. The book concludes by extending polaron concepts to address critical aspects of four multifaceted electronic and atomic problems: large bipolarons' superconductivity, electronic switching of small-polaron semiconductors, electronically stimulated atomic desorption and diffusion of light interstitial atoms.},

It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+˜n(r), ˜nn0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(rr0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

  abstract = {In this paper is described a model for polaron motion which incorporates, in simplified form, the principal physical features of the problem. The (crystalline) medium, within which a single excess electron (or hole) is contained, is taken to be a one-dimensional molecular crystal, consisting of diatomic molecular sites; each site possesses a single vibrational degree of freedom, represented by the deviation, xn, of its internuclear separation from equilibrium. The motion of the electron in this medium is treated by a tight-binding approach, in which the wave function is represented as a superposition of local “molecular” functions, φ(r − na, xn). In line with the xn dependence of the δ's, it is also assumed that the “local” electronic energy, En, (which, in the conventional tight-binding theory, has one and the same value for all sites) depends (linearly) on xn. This dependence gives rise to electron-lattice interaction; alternatively, it may be regarded as removing the electronic translational degeneracy, characteristic of the undistorted crystal, and thereby providing the possibility for electron trapping. On the basis of the above-described model, the zeroth order adiabatic treatment of the polaron problem is developed. For values of the parameters such that the linear dimension of the polaron is large compared to a lattice spacing (“large” polaron), an exact solution is obtained; the correspondence between it and Pekar's zeroth-order solution is established. The conditions under which the size of the polaron becomes comparable to a lattice spacing (“small” polaron) are discussed. Finally, by way of exhibiting the relationship of the molecular-crystal concept to the real situation, a description is given of an alternate molecular-crystal model which, in the case of the large polaron, is completely equivalent to the continuum-polarization model of conventional polaron theory.},

  abstract = {The behavior of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and other transition-metal oxides is key to the many applications of these materials. Experiments seem to produce conflicting results: optical and spin-resonance techniques reveal strongly localized small polarons, while electrical measurements show high mobilities that can only be explained by delocalized free electrons. By means of hybrid functional calculations we resolve this apparent contradiction and show that small polarons can actually coexist with delocalized electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, the former being energetically only slightly more favorable. We also find that small polarons can form complexes with oxygen vacancies and ionized shallow-donor impurities, explaining the rich spectrum of Ti3+ species observed in electron spin resonance experiments.

In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 23.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic fields are also treated by similar methods.

  abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay’s DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N3atoms operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay’s scheme. A special ‘‘metric’’ and a special ‘‘preconditioning’’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N2atoms scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package).

All’interno di questo lavoro di tesi verranno quindi esposti i principali concetti che hanno portato a indicare l’Idrogeno come promettente carburante in un futuro ecosostenibile, analizzando nel primo capitolo i suoi punti di forza e le criticità legate al suo trasporto che lo rendono ancora lontano dal pareggiare economicamente con il petrolio. Verrà inoltre mostrato come la soluzione più promettente è costituita dal trasporto in mezzi solidi costituiti dagli ibridi metallici del Magnesio, tecnologia per cui un indagine teorico-computazionale può risultare efficace dipanando dubbi sulla termodinamica della reazione o possibili effetti catalitici. Nel capitolo due verranno quindi esposte le basi teoriche per lo studio numerico di tali sistemi basati sulla teoria del funzionale densità, andando poi a descrivere le principali tecniche d’implementazione nel capitolo terzo. Nell’ultima parte dell’elaborato verranno infine mostrati i risultati ottenuti dallo studio, effettuato attraverso VASP, delle proprietà di assorbimento della superficie Mg(0001) pura o in presenza dei dopanti Ni e Ti.

By refolding into the primitive Brillouin zone of the pristine crystal we recover the conventional unfolded bands. We implement our algorithm in the Siesta package.

We look at the structure of the polaron cloud and answer such questions as the average number of phonons in the cloud and their number/momentum distribution.

  abstract = {Polarons are formed in polar or ionic solids, either molecular or crystalline, due to local distortions of the lattice induced by charge carriers. Polaron hopping is the primary mechanism of charge transport in these materials, such as functional ceramic compounds, with applications in photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, two-dimensional electron gas transistors, magnetic sensors, spin valve devices, and memories. Understanding the fundamental physics of polaron hopping is, therefore, of prime technological importance. This article provides a brief physical background of polarons and their hopping mechanism, focusing on first-principles calculations of polaron properties. Herein, we review recent selected studies applying the density functional theory (DFT), and describe the merits and challenges in applying DFT for such calculations, highlighting the need to address both electronic and vibrational aspects. The vibrational component of the polaron is evaluated based on structural and total energy calculations, whereas the electronic component is derived from both total energy and electron density calculations. To address the most compelling challenge of calculating polaron properties using DFT, which is the issue of electron localization, we propose to employ calculations of selected vibrational properties, such as the sound velocity, shear modulus, and Grüneisen parameter, to represent the polaron hopping energy; all of which originate from the stiffness of inter-atomic bonds. Such methodology is expected to be more straightforward than the existing ones, however demands standardization.},

We focus on rutile TiO2, a prototypical polaronic compound, and compare the formation of polarons on the (110) surface and subsurface atomic layers. As expected, the parameter U used to correct the electronic correlation in the DFT + U formalism affects the resulting charge localization, local structural distortions and electronic properties of polarons. Moreover, the polaron localization can be driven to different sites by strain: due to different local environments, surface and subsurface polarons show different responses to the applied strain, with impact on the relative energy stability. An accurate description of the properties of polarons is key to understand their impact on complex phenomena and applications: as an example, we show the effects of lattice strain on the interaction between polarons and CO adsorbates.},

Überhaupt ist es für alles Folgende charakteristisch, daß keine neuen physikalischen Hypothesen über das Verhalten der Metallatome und ihre Wechselwirkung mit den Elektronen gebildet, sondern daß die Hypothesen der alten Elektronentheorie lediglich mit den Formeln der neuen Statistik durchgerechnet werden. § 4 behandelt die Leitungsprobleme, § 5 die Phänomene an der Oberfläche der Leiter, insbesondere den Richardsoneffekt, während der Voltaeffekt hier zunächst zurückgestellt wird. § 6 und 7 formulieren die verschiedenen thermoelektrischen, galvanomagnetischen und thermomagnetischen Effekte; diese beiden letzten Paragraphen werden zusammen mit kritischen Schlußbemerkungen den zweiten Teil der vorliegenden Abhandlung bilden.},

  abstract = {The Holstein Hamiltonian was proposed half a century ago; since then, decades of research have come up empty handed in the pursuit of a closed-form solution. An exact solution to the two-site Holstein model is presented in this paper. The obtained results provide a clear image of the Hamiltonian structure and allow for the investigation of the symmetry, energy level crossings and polaronic characteristics of the system. The main mathematical tool is a three-term recurrence relation between the wave function amplitudes, which was obtained using the properties of a family of orthogonal functions, namely the Poisson–Charlier polynomials. It is shown that, with the appropriate choice of basis, the eigenfunctions of the problem naturally fall into two families (parities) associated with the discrete symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The asymptotic solution to the recurrence relation is found by using the Birkhoff expansion. The asymptotic sets the truncation criterion for the wave function, which ensures the accurate calculation of the energy levels for any strength of electron–phonon interaction. The level crossing of states with different parities is discussed and the exact points of broken symmetry are found analytically. The results are used as the building blocks for studying a four-site system. The inherited symmetries lead to the formation of a sparse matrix that is convenient for numerical calculations.},

  abstract = {This chapter introduces the Hubbard model and its applicability as a corrective tool for accurate modeling of the electronic properties of various classes of systems. The attainment of a correct description of electronic structure is critical for predicting further electronic-related properties, including intermolecular interactions and formation energies. The chapter begins with an introduction to the formulation of density functional theory (DFT) functionals, while addressing the origin of bandgap problem with correlated materials. Then, the corrective approaches proposed to solve the DFT bandgap problem are reviewed, while comparing them in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The Hubbard model will then offer a simple approach to correctly describe the behavior of highly correlated materials, known as the Mot insulators. Based on Hubbard model, DFT+U scheme is built, which is computationally convenient for accurate calculations of electronic structures. Later in this chapter, the computational and semiempirical methods of optimizing the value of the Coulomb interaction potential (U) are discussed, while evaluating the conditions under which it can be most predictive. The chapter focuses on highlighting the use of U to correct the description of the physical properties, by reviewing the results of case studies presented in literature for various classes of materials.},
