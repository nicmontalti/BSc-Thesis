## Abstract

The aim of this thesis is to introduce the polaron concept and to perform a DFT numerical calculation of a small polaron in the rutile phase of $\ce{TiO_2}$. In the first chapters, we present an analytical study of small and large polarons, based on the Holstein and Fröhlich Hamiltonians. The necessary mathematical formalism and physics fundamentals are briefly reviewed in the first chapter. In the second part of the thesis, Density Functional Theory (DFT) is introduced together with the DFT+U correction and its implementation in the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP). The calculation of a small polaron in rutile is then described and discussed at a qualitative level. The polaronic solution is compared with the one of a delocalized electron.

The calculation showed how the polaron creates a new energy level 0.70 eV below the conduction band. The energy level is visible both in the band structure diagram and in the density of states diagram. The electron is localized on a titanium atom, distorting the surrounding lattice. In particular, the four oxygen atoms closer to the titanium atom are displaced by 0.085 Å outwards, whereas the two further oxygen atoms by 0.023 Å. The results are compatible, at a qualitative level, with the literature. Further developments of this work may try to improve the precision of the results and to quantitatively compare them with the literature.
